## My process
I developed this with a mobile first mindset, which is a first for me. I took a different approach on this project and mainly used it as a chance to get back into CSS after a deep dive into basic JavaScript.
My process was to:
1. Establish the skeleton, closely building the layout with HTML alone.
2. Prepopulate my stylesheet with anything I would need for the project, including all colors and fonts at :root.
3. Style each componement with a mobile first workflow; aiming for accuracy to source material.
4. Add media queries for desktop viewports

My main takeaways are:
- Mobile first development is DEFINITELY the way to go, it was easier to finish and overall a much more enjoyable experience.
- I need to style with DRY in mind. I could have eliminated alot of bloat in the stylesheet but redundant styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma

### What I learned

I learned to build and style with a mobile first mindset. I have historically always built desktop before mobile but after really committing to mobile first, I have seen the error of my ways. No longer will I labor over long media queries because the mobile view shares more differences than similarities.

I also learned that I CAN write HTML that arent just `<div>`'s!

### Continued development

To continue my developement, I will focus more on mobile first workflows, semantic HTML and DRY.
